# Backlog package

## Responsibilities

The Backlog package provides the Backlog workspace. It owns the canonical `backlog/todo.yaml` projection, linked-plan rendering, and its constrained conversational agent. It is explicitly configured in `.resonance/config.json` and contributes only namespaced routes and assets. Its browser state is isolated under the Backlog package's local-storage namespace: agent-panel visibility, collapsed status groups, and the selected plan are restored and written immediately when changed.

## Configuration

```json
"backlog": {
  "module": "src/packages/backlog/index.ts",
  "provider": "openrouter",
  "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"
}
```

The provider and model are non-secret package inputs. `openai` and the OpenAI-compatible `openrouter` provider are supported. For OpenRouter, the runtime uses `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` and the configured model id directly. The API key is never configuration, prompt, transcript, state, response, or SSE data. It may be entered through the agent and is stored only in the repository-local, gitignored `.resonance/backlog-agent.env` with mode `0600` under the provider-specific key name (`OPENAI_API_KEY` or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

## Routes and lifecycle

- `GET /api/backlog/items` returns the ordered, physically contained Decisions projection.
- `GET /api/backlog/plan?path=...` re-authorizes and renders one canonical linked plan with its metadata.
- `POST /api/backlog/metadata` deterministically updates a decision's status and/or priority.
- `POST /api/backlog/delete` deletes a decision's linked plan and YAML entry after browser confirmation.
- `GET /api/backlog/agent/state` returns non-secret conversation state.
- `GET /api/backlog/agent/events` is a snapshot-first SSE stream.
- `POST /api/backlog/agent/prompt` accepts `{ prompt, selectedPath }`.
- `POST /api/backlog/agent/credential` accepts a local key but returns no key data.
- `POST /api/backlog/agent/confirm-deletion` accepts a server-issued confirmation id.
- `POST /api/backlog/agent/reset` starts a fresh in-memory chat.

The provider runtime is lazy: navigation, selection, state reads, and SSE subscriptions do not construct the configured provider client or DeepAgents. One process-local conversation is shared across the package and concurrent prompts receive `409`.

## Telemetry

Each conversation has a stable telemetry session identity. Backlog records complete user/assistant I/O on each agent turn and the full known system/conversation request plus every textual model response on each model-stream generation. The host exports those fields when `RESONANCE_TELEMETRY_CAPTURE_CONTENT=true`; provider credentials remain excluded and secret-looking values remain redacted.

## Authority and mutations

The agent receives a freshly re-read selected decision on every prompt. Its virtual filesystem exposes the packaged management skill plus read-only listing, reading, glob, and grep access across the viewed repository, allowing it to use documentation and implementation evidence when preparing or relating decisions. Repository symlinks, Git internals, and credential files are unavailable, reads are bounded, and generic filesystem writes remain denied. Domain tools enforce canonical Backlog paths, YAML validation, repository containment, serialized mutations, atomic individual replacements, and compensating rollback. The agent can review, create, edit plans, change status or priority, and request deletion. New decisions use a deterministic `plans/<kebab-case-title>.md` path derived by the domain tool; callers do not choose the plan path. Deletion always requires a visible browser confirmation and a chat request alone has no destructive effect.

Committed mutations emit a revision and affected canonical paths. The browser then re-reads the YAML and plan from disk rather than applying optimistic changes; the plan metadata controls use the same canonical store for deterministic status and priority changes. The plan view's delete button requires explicit browser confirmation before calling the direct deletion route. Shell, credential inspection, network access, persistence, and cross-process transactionality remain non-goals.
