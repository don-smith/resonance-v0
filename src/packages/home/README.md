# Home package

The Home package provides the repository landing page. It reads the configured source from `.resonance/config.json`, returns its original content and browser-ready HTML, and mounts that content inside a private Home surface. Shell opens this surface from the repository title rather than listing it as a workspace.

## Responsibilities

- Read `packages.home.source` from `.resonance/config.json`.
- Fall back to `README.md` when no config is present.
- Accept relative `.md`, `.markdown`, `.html`, and `.htm` sources.
- Render Markdown with the safe shared Markdown renderer.
- Insert repository-owned HTML sources unchanged so a repository can provide a distinct landing page with scoped styles.
- Serve `/api/home` and the Home browser assets.
- Contribute the package-owned `create-home-page` onboarding Task when the default or invalid source still needs curation.
- Contribute no workspace navigation item; Shell makes its repository title clickable when Home loads successfully.

## Configuration

Configure Home as an entry in the repository manifest’s `packages` object:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "packages": {
    "home": {
      "module": "src/packages/home/index.ts",
      "source": "README.md"
    }
  }
}
```

- `module` is required at load time and must be a non-empty path relative to the Resonance application root.
- `enabled` is an optional common package flag; `false` omits Home from the host.
- `source` is optional and defaults to `README.md`. It must be a non-empty relative path ending in `.md`, `.markdown`, `.html`, or `.htm`; the host only reads files contained in the repository root.

Home reads the configured source through the host repository-containment boundary. Markdown is safely rendered to HTML; HTML is trusted repository-owned markup and is inserted unchanged. Omit Home from `packages`, or set `enabled` to `false`, when the landing-page surface is not needed. Without Home, Shell renders the repository title as a non-clickable control.

## Home onboarding Task

When Home is configured with the default `README.md` source, or its configured source is missing or invalid, Home contributes `home:create-home-page` to Resonance Actions. The Task owns its bounded documentation discovery policy and excludes dependencies, generated directories, repository internals, credentials, and unreadable files. It prepares an HTML preview with subtle source-document references and affected paths, then requires explicit confirmation before atomically writing `.resonance/home.html` and updating the Home package source. Existing custom sources are never overwritten. Runtime validation re-reads the configured HTML source through the same containment rules used by Home; completion is evidence-based and dismissal is stored separately in package state.

The Task uses the generic Resonance Actions session and exposes only its Home curation skill and operations. The skill is maintained at `skills/create-home-page/SKILL.md` beside the package implementation and is loaded as the Task's scoped guidance. It does not receive shell, network, credentials, or unrestricted filesystem access.

## Ownership boundary

`src/packages/home/` contains reusable package implementation. Configured sources such as `.resonance/home.html`, `README.md`, and repository Markdown remain under the viewed repository root and are resolved through the host containment API, never relative to this package folder.

HTML sources are inserted as trusted local markup. Point the manifest only at files owned by the repository, and scope page-specific selectors below a page root such as `.repository-home`.
